In addition to providing insights about visual encoding techniques and designs utilized by the different publication venues, this database is also a resource for cognitive and perceptual experiments.';

It contains twelve visualization categories and several popular subtypes for each category. In addition, we supply a set of properties that aid in the characterization of the visualizations. This taxonomy was created originally to classify the 2k dataset, and we continue to use this terminology in our papers.",
