  essential for effective data presentation as well as communication to the viewer. To gain deeper \
  insight into what elements of a visualization affect its memorability, recognition, recall, and \
  comprehension, we constructed the MASSVIS Database.  This database, one of the largest to date of \
  real-world visualizations, was constructed by scraping multiple online sources of visualizations from \
  various publication venues including government reports, infographic blogs, news media websites, and \
  scientific journals. The diversity and distribution of these visualizations represent a broad set of \
  data visualizations "in the wild".  In addition to gaining insight into the visual encoding techniques\
   and designs utilized by the different publication venues, this database also serves as a resource for\
    cognitive and perceptual experiments.';
  $scope.projectSubDesc = "The database consists of over 5,693 static visualizations of which 2,070 are “single” with visualization type information, and additionally 410 of these visualizations have extensive annotations, memorability scores, eye-movements, and labels."
